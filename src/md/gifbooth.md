### Gifbooth

GIFbooth is where the fun begins at any event. Itâ€™s like a photo booth, but with gifs! If you're at an event with a GIFbooth, you can record gifs and add animated filters to capture the moment and share it with others.

GIFbooth is an installation that allows for collaboration between brands, digital artists, and the general public.
