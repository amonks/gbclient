### Gifbooth

GIFbooth is where the fun begins at any event. It's like a photo booth, but with gifs! If you see a GIFbooth, you can record gifs and add animated filters to capture the moment and share it with others.

It's an installation that allows for collaboration between brands, digital artists, and the general public.

GIFbooth is a thing by [Studio Studio NYC](//ssttuuddiioo.com/).

The website is a thing by [Andrew Monks](//monks.co).
